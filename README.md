# Bright-Coffee-Shop-Sale-Analysis
### Introduction ###
I was assigned to perform an analytical study on Bright Coffee Shop’s sales using recorded transactional data from January to June 2025. The dataset includes daily sales data from three store locations: Hell’s Kitchen, Astoria, and Lower Manhattan. This dataset serves as the foundation for the case study.
Following the recent appointment of a new CEO focused on increasing revenue and improving product performance, my role as a Data Analyst is to examine historical data, extract actionable insights, and develop a presentation to support informed decision-making.
